When using new-if, my scheme interpreter gobbles up a bunch of memory and is
eventually killed by the OOM killer. This is because new-if isn't a special
form. new-if evaluates all of its arguments, the predicate, then-clause, and
else-clause, before it goes through the cond. This is a side-effect of
applicative order. if, being a special form, does not suffer that. Note that
it will only "not work" when a predicate infinitely recurses or has side
effects.
